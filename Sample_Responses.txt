Command: Make flashcards for Python data types.
Response:
# Python Data Types Flashcards

## Card 1
**Q: What are the basic numeric data types in Python?**
**A:** `int` (integers), `float` (floating-point numbers), and `complex` (complex numbers)

---

## Card 2
**Q: How do you create a string in Python?**
**A:** Using single quotes `'hello'`, double quotes `"hello"`, or triple quotes `"""hello"""` for multi-line strings

---

## Card 3
**Q: What is the difference between a list and a tuple?**
**A:** Lists are mutable (can be changed) and use square brackets `[1, 2, 3]`. Tuples are immutable (cannot be changed) and use parentheses `(1, 2, 3)`

---

## Card 4
**Q: What data type would you use to store unique values?**
**A:** `set` - it automatically removes duplicates and uses curly braces `{1, 2, 3}`

---

## Card 5
**Q: How do you create a dictionary in Python?**
**A:** Using curly braces with key-value pairs: `{'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}`

---

## Card 6
**Q: What are the two boolean values in Python?**
**A:** `True` and `False` (note the capitalization)

---

## Card 7
**Q: What does `None` represent in Python?**
**A:** `None` represents the absence of a value or a null value

---

## Card 8
**Q: How do you check the data type of a variable?**
**A:** Use the `type()` function: `type(variable_name)`

---

## Card 9
**Q: What is the difference between `'5'` and `5`?**
**A:** `'5'` is a string (text), while `5` is an integer (number)

---

## Card 10
**Q: How do you convert a string to an integer?**
**A:** Use the `int()` function: `int('5')` returns `5`

---

## Card 11
**Q: What happens when you try to change an element in a tuple?**
**A:** You get a `TypeError` because tuples are immutable

---

## Card 12
**Q: How do you create an empty list, tuple, set, and dictionary?**
**A:** 
- Empty list: `[]` or `list()`
- Empty tuple: `()` or `tuple()`
- Empty set: `set()` (not `{}`)
- Empty dictionary: `{}` or `dict()`

---

## Card 13
**Q: What is the difference between `==` and `is`?**
**A:** `==` checks if values are equal, `is` checks if two variables point to the same object in memory

---

## Card 14
**Q: How do you access elements in a list?**
**A:** Using square brackets with an index: `my_list[0]` for the first element, `my_list[-1]` for the last element

---

## Card 15
**Q: What data type is returned by `input()` function?**
**A:** Always returns a `str` (string), even if the user enters numbers

---

## Card 16
**Q: How do you create a multi-line string?**
**A:** Using triple quotes: `"""This is a multi-line string"""` or `'''This is also a multi-line string'''

---

## Card 17
**Q: What is string interpolation and how do you do it?**
**A:** Inserting variables into strings. Use f-strings: `f"Hello {name}"` or `.format()`: `"Hello {}".format(name)`

---

## Card 18
**Q: How do you add elements to a list?**
**A:** 
- `append()` to add one element at the end
- `insert()` to add at a specific position
- `extend()` to add multiple elements

---

## Card 19
**Q: What is the difference between `remove()` and `pop()` for lists?**
**A:** `remove()` removes the first occurrence of a value, `pop()` removes and returns an element at a specific index (last by default)

---

## Card 20
**Q: How do you get all the keys from a dictionary?**
**A:** Use the `.keys()` method: `my_dict.keys()`

---

## Card 21
**Q: What data type is `range(5)`?**
**A:** It's a `range` object, not a list. Convert to list with `list(range(5))`

---

## Card 22
**Q: How do you check if a key exists in a dictionary?**
**A:** Use the `in` operator: `'key' in my_dict`

---

## Card 23
**Q: What is the difference between shallow copy and deep copy?**
**A:** Shallow copy creates a new object but references to nested objects remain the same. Deep copy creates completely independent copies of all nested objects.

---

## Card 24
**Q: How do you combine two lists?**
**A:** 
- Using `+` operator: `list1 + list2`
- Using `extend()`: `list1.extend(list2)`
- Using unpacking: `[*list1, *list2]`

---

## Card 25
**Q: What is the difference between `float('inf')` and `float('nan')`?**
**A:** `float('inf')` represents positive infinity, `float('nan')` represents "Not a Number" (undefined/invalid operations)
